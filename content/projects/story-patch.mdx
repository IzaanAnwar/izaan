Story Patch is an open source web app that lets you contribute to stories, one patch at a time. It's a collaborative platform that allows you to create, edit, and vote on stories. You can also start a new story and invite others to contribute their creative patches.
###### Contribute a Patch
Add a paragraph to an ongoing story and see it evolve with contributions from others.

###### Vote on Patches
Review and vote for the best patches. The most popular ones get merged into the main story.

###### Start a New Story
Begin a new story, set the stage, and invite others to contribute their creative patches.
